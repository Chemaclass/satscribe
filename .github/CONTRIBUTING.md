## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

In your bug report, please provide the following:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
    * Be specific!
    * Give sample code if you can.
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens

## Workflow for Pull Requests

1. Fork/clone the repository.
2. Create your branch from `main` if you plan to implement new functionality or change existing code significantly.
3. Implement your change and add tests for it.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Ensure the code complies with our coding guidelines (see below).
6. Send that pull request!

Please make sure you have [set up your username and email address](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` looks bad in the commit history of a project.

## Change the configuration
